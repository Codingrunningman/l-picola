{"name":"L-PICOLA","tagline":"Sweet simulations with added caffeine","body":"L-PICOLA is a distributed-memory, parallel code for creating fast, accurate, dark matter simulations.\r\n* How parallel? Well we've run it on over 1000 processors without a hitch.\r\n* How fast? Due to the algorithms used and coding, it is ~1000 times faster than an identical full N-Body simulation\r\n* How accurate? We can reproduce the two and three-point clustering of dark matter to within 5% on all scales used for current BAO and RSD measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
